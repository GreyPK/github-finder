## About Project

This is simple react app for search github users.
This app is deployed to [https://github-finder-with-react.netlify.com/](https://github-finder-with-react.netlify.com/).
For the state management I used react context.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
